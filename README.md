<h1>Gatsby ReactJS website</h1>

**Project Overview:**

This project is a multifaceted Gatsby ReactJS website, showcasing three distinct applications/pages.

<h2>Home Page:</h2>

The entry point of the website features a HTML5 canvas background, simulating a dynamic starry sky with stars that appear at random coordinates. These stars exhibit random sizes, colors, and incorporate fade-in and fade-out animations to create a mesmerizing visual effect through the HTML5 canvas.
The home page also serves as a portal to the other two ReactJS applications contained within the site, each linked for easy navigation.

<h2>Aquarium Encyclopedia:</h2>

This ReactJS application acts as a comprehensive guide to various fish species. It includes:
- A search field and filters for users to easily find information on specific fish.
- A dynamic list of fish that updates based on the search criteria.
- A pop-up window that provides detailed information about the selected fish, including water type, diet, and optimal water conditions.
